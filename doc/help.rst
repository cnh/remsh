Getting Help
============

Remsh is currently in its early days, and doesn't yet have a community.  It is
an offshoot of the `Buildbot <http://buildbot.net>`_ project, and as such
Buildbot's support channels are also appropriate for remsh.  In particular, you
can usually find Dustin in ``#buildbot`` on Freenode's IRC servers, or via
email on the ``buildbot-devel@lists.sourceforge.net`` mailing list.

Please record any bugs or feature requests for remsh in the `Github Issues Page
<http://github.com/djmitche/remsh/issues/>`_.
